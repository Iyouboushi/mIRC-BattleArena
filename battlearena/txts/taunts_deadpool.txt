Gonna rough you up like a Broadway musical
Have gun, will shoot!
I still get paid, right?
Slinging in the wind!
Wataaaaaa!
I'm the ghost of Christmas Kick-Your-Butt!
Who was I supposed to kill again? Meh, it doesn't matter.
Hey, you! Yeah, $nick(#,$rand(1, $nick(#,0))) $+ ! Here I am busting my butt while you sit on yours. How is that fair?
Deadpool-Man! Deadpool-Man! Does whatever Deadpool can! Makes a plan, any size, catches thieves and makes them die. Look out! There goes the Deadpool-Man!
I hear bullets taste like chicken!
I love me some PINEAPPLE!
YO MAMA!
BATHROOM BREAK!
CHIMICHANGAS!
Don't even like chimichangas all that much. I just love saying it. Chimichanga. Chimichanga. Chimichanga. Chimichanga.
Anime power up time!
Get along little doggy!
HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?
Everyone knows that taunts in Battle Arena are just turn wasters!
BANG! BANG BANG BANG! BANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!
Hey, don't make me get $nick(#,$rand(1, $nick(#,0))) to come beat you up!
Did I leave the stove on?
Shhh. My common sense is tingling.
At the end of the day, this is a Deadpool problem. There's only one way to deal with those. And it looks a lot like this.
Bring me more Pop Rocks and Dr. Pepper. Prepare to bathe my monkeys.
We're going to need a new arena.
Packing chips! THAT'S the greatest weapon on the face of the planet - packing chips! Just IMAGINE getting nailed by some of these babies! Oh the HUMANITY!
You guys should really take a break from all YOUR carnage and mayhem... and come take a look at all THIS carnage and mayhem!
How do you say "Oh, $#@!" in Skrull-ese?
I'm gonna join the X-Men!
Nope. No more jokes. My name is Wade Wilson. You killed my friend. Prepare to die.
This isn't even my final form!
But despite all of our super powers, armor, shields, and other various knick-knacks, the only person on Earth who could stop the mega-puke-o-tron was Deadpool. Which is why we hired him to straight up kill Earth's biggest threat. Five stars. Would merc again.
