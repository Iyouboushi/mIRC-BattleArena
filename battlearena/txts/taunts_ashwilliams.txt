Hail to the king, baby!
Come get some.
Groovy.
Name's Ash. Housewares.
That's right... who's laughing now... who's laughing *now*!?
Let's head on down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch.
You're goin' down!
Buckle up Bonehead. 'Cause you're goin' for a ride!
Let's go!
Your pain, my gain!
Now whoa whoa whoa right there spinach chin!
Hey, nice face! Let me fix it for you!
Whoa! Were you born that ugly?
You're stinking up my town!
We can take these monsters, we can take 'em! With science!
Hey ugly, I got something that'll clear that right up.
That can't be your face... Did your neck throw up?
Let's tango.
Rest in pieces, dirt bag.
One look at you and I know why some animals eat thier young.
Sorry, I missed that. You said something about eating my soul?
So, tell me about yourself. Is there a Mrs or Mr Ugly to keep you cold at night?
Hey, wouldn't you just like to sit down and discuss our differences? No? Me neither.
Listen up, shake and bake. I eat evil for breakfast and danger for dinner!
I'm about two ticks away from cleaning your clock!
%enemy $+ , I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.
Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.
Hey! What's that you got on your face?
Run home and cry to mama!
Say hello to the twenty-first century!
Hey %enemy $+ , your shoe lace is untied!
Well hello Mister Fancypants!
Oh, I'll be polite. Right up until when I'm rude!
Death, taxes, more death, and I don't pay taxes. So all I know is death.
Alright you primitive screwheads, listen up! You see this? This... is my BOOMSTICK! The twelve-gauge double-barreled Remington. S-Mart's top of the line. You can find this in the sporting goods department. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Retails for about a hundred and nine, ninety five. It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel, and a hair trigger. That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart. You got that?!
