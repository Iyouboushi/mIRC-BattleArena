Get lost, you can't compare with my powers!
Anyone who opposes me will be destroyed!
You're no match for my Psycho Power!
Have you no conception of who I am?! I massacre the likes of you by the dozen!
Now you understand your worthlessness! You fighters exist only to be crushed!
Of course!
Game over!
Yes! YES!
You cannot fight destiny. The world will be mine.
Fear and respect... the supreme energy that is Psycho Power!
What strikes horror into your heart, is simply humor to me.
You are mistaken. I'm no demon. My power has evolved beyond that level.
Psycho Power will never lose.
You should thank me. Now you know the truth. The truth of total fear. Ha!
What a limp, pansy foe you are. If I'm so scary to you, why not run home to mommy!
Bow before me!
My Psycho Power knows no limits!
I will be reborn as many times as it takes! Bison is eternal!
I'm afraid your quest has come to a most unfortunate end!
For me, it was a Tuesday!
Bwa ha ha ha! All who oppose the mighty Bison will regret it in the afterlife!
Behold the majesty of my Psycho Power.
The mighty Bison is here to administer last rites.
It's laughable that you thought your shrewd parlor tricks would work on me!
