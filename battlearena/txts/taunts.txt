You scared?
Come on, wimp!
Come and get me!
What'd you say?
Shall we dance?
Come on!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on baby!
All right baby!
Hey, what's up?
Showdown!
Sweet, baby!
Craaaazy!
You shall die!
Hmph. What's wrong?
How boring.
You sure know how to throw a party!
Oh you poor thing, didn't your mother ever teach you how to use a door?
What's the matter? Chicken?
Who's your daddy %enemy $+ ?
Hey! Do your job!
Let's start the party!
You? A threat? Don't make me laugh!
Fighting you is boring!
You fight like a dairy farmer!
Would you like to be buried or cremated?
I can't rest 'til you've been exterminated!
My attacks have left entire islands depopulated!
Your looks would make pigs nauseated!
Nothing can stop me from blowing you away!
Die %enemy $+ ! You don't belong in this world!
Well hello Mister Fancypants!
Groovy!
Hail to the king, baby!
Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.
Hey! What's that you got on your face?
Run home and cry to mama!
Hey, nice face! Let me fix it for you.
Whoa! Were you born that ugly?
Hey ugly, I got something that'll clear that right up.
So, tell me about yourself. Is there a Mrs or Mr Ugly to keep you cold at night?
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
What's the matter? Why the glare %enemy $+ ?
Nice going Noodlehead!
Wow %enemy $+ ! You look like your face was on fire and someone tried to put it out with a fork!
NI!
You don't frighten me, English pig-dog!
I blow my nose at you, %enemy $+ !
How appropriate. You fight like a cow!
Flock off, feather-face!
Hey %enemy $+ ! If I wanted to kill myself I'd climb your ego and jump to your IQ!
If you choke a smurf, what color will it turn?
You hit worse than a wet washcloth!
You fight like a cow's cadaver!
