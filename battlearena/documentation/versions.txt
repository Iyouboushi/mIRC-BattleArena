1.3
- Added the "translation.dat" file that contains most of the bot messages.  You can edit this file to do translations or
  to just change the way various messages read. Open it in notepad.
- Added the active skill "Analysis".  This skill lets you analyze a monster.  Increased levels of the skill gives you more
  information about the monster.  To use it, after purchasing it, use !analyze monstername  You can only analyze monsters

- Added the passive skill "Haggling" -- This skill will increase the amount of orbs you get for selling items by 20*skill level
  EXCEPT in cases where the amount you'd get from haggling is more than the actual cost of the item (i.e. a potion).  
  In that case you just get the original item price back, or up to 500 orbs back if it goes over 500.
- Added the passive skill "WeaponBash" -- This skill will give a chance of inflicting the 'stun' status effect to a target
  with each melee hit. Note, if the target is immune to stun it will never take effect.

  "DiscountCard" has been added as an example item. 250,000 orbs and will lower it by 10 points.

  they will receive the "revive" status.  If that person dies in the same battle, they will be revived automatically

  0-5 damage max if the person using them isn't a monster or a NPC.
- Added the ability for techs to change which base stat is used for damage. You can add a stat= with the stat you want
  to use in the tech file.  For example:  stat=str  or stat=spd     By default it's int.
- Added the Heal-AOE type. This type will heal all allies on the battlefield. This tech type can't be used on enemies.
- Added the ability to sell items back to the shop. Use !shop sell item (item name) (amount) to sell them back.
- Added the ability for monsters/bosses to be "staggered" -- if they sustain enough damage they'll collapse and will 
  be unable to move for a round.  They can only be staggered once per battle. In the [info] section of a monster/boss you can
  add CanStagger=yes  then add StaggerAmount=$rand(#,#)   where # is the amount of hp you want the range to be. Stagger will
  activate when damage exceeds the random amount picked from the range.
- Added the Quicksilver style. This still allows players to use the !quicksilver command that will freeze everyone except the
  user in time. Players can use the !quicksilver command in battle as many times as style's level. The effect basically gives
  players a free Sugitekai.
- Added the ability for monsters to ignore the darkness/rage mode system.  In [info] you can put RageMode=ignore  if you 
  want them to not get the darkness/rage mode bonus.

  from automatically taking effect.

- Added accessories to the bot! Once you get one you can use !wear (accessory name) to put it on and 
  !remove (accessory name) if you want to remove it.
- Added two AI types for monsters. They are: Defender and Berserker.  Defender type monsters won't attack at all during 
  battle and Berserker type monsters may attack their own allies at random. You can change it  in [info] ai_type=         
  Leave it blank if you want monsters to act as normal.
- Added the beginning of an achievement system.
- Added the max shop level in the system.dat.  Bot owners can now change it to whatever they want. By default it's 25.
- Added a new boss type fight: Doppelganger.  It's a rare, 5% chance, event that instead of summoning a normal boss, players
  will have to fight evil copies of themselves. Bot owners can disable it in the system.dat by setting EnableDoppenganger 
  to false.
- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses
- Added new summons
- Added new NPCs
- Changed the way the monster/boss/npc lists are generated to hopefully make them more random and to prevent a future bug.
- Changed the prices of several skills/weapon upgrades/techs/items.
- Changed the max amount of damage of suicide techs that can be done by players to 500.  This should prevent someone with
  hundreds of thousands of hp one-shotting every monster/boss in the game.
- Changed the maximum number of times a target can be successfully stolen from to 2.
- Changed the maximum amount of HP you can buy from the shop. The default is 2500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of TP you can buy from the shop. The default is 500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of style points you can accumulate in one battle to 5000.
- Changed the location of the skill cooldown times into the skills.db. Bot Owners can now edit that file to edit skill reuse times
- Changed the way boss drops works so that they can have multiple drops. The bot will still only pick one drop, but now you can
  make it random.
- Changed it so if multiple bosses enter the battle, all of their drops should be in the pool rather than just the
  most recent boss to join.
- Changed the damage formula on poison.  Instead of doing random 5-10 damage a turn (which is nothing when players 
  have HP over 1000), it now does a percentage of a target's max HP.  The "Heavily Poisoned" status does even more than 
  normal poison.
- Changed the next turn timer so that it's only 3 minutes instead of 5.
- Changed the damage formula slightly for 4 hit and 5 hit attacks.
- Changed the code so that boss battles may spawn normal monsters as well when the winning streak is greater than 50.

  by 25% (plus a random 1-5% at random) each level.

  Amount=  under [OrbHunter].  Default is now 15*skill level.

  it would be reset to level 1. 
- Fixed a bug that was letting players purchase monster weapons.
- Fixed a bug in which fleeing would cause the bot to break in a one vs one battle against an orb fountain.
- Fixed a bug in which you could use consumable items with the !use command and the item would be decreased from your inventory.
- Fixed a bug in which MightyStrike could be used continuously without a cooldown.
- Fixed a bug where if something was weak to lightning it would also take double damage for light element as well.

  once you load the current save you have will be reset.
- Added keys. Keys are dropped by monsters randomly after the 15th win on the winning streak. The person who gets the key is

- Changed the way the utsusemi/royalguard/manawall blocked messages are displayed. They're shown after the attack desc now, not
  before it. This actually saves a line being pushed to the channel.
- Changed the way status types are inflicted upon a target. Much cleaner code and now any type of tech or weapon can inflict a 
  status.  Just add a StatusType=(status type) to the weapon/tech.  The Type=Status is now defunct, and it should be set as 
  Single or AOE.

  IP addresses and people have logged into their characters with this feature on (so that it stores the IPs).  
  The max # of chars allowed is in system.dat and can be changed to the bot owner's liking.
- Added the ability for monsters and clones to change their weapons in the middle of battle before attacking.
  Neither can change to glyphs if they aren't already equipped when the clone/doppelganger is created. Note that regular
  monsters and bosses have a higher rate of changing their weapons vs both types of doppelgangers.
- Added the active skill Provoke -- Will cause a monster you use it on to attack you its next round instead of another target.
- Added the active skill Disarm -- Will attempt to disarm a target back to their base fists. 
- Added the active skill "WeaponLock" -- Will consume Sokubaku to lock a target's weapon in place for a # of turns.

  top 3 players based on a number of factors (including stats, orbs, chests opened, etc).
- Added the !score command. This command will show players their individual scores.
- Added a new flag in system.dat that bot owners can toggle manually.  It's called ShowOrbsCmdInChannel=true/false   
  If true, the !orbs command will display the person's orb total in channel.  If set false, it will send it to the person 
  in a private message. 
- Added a bonus effect to using a weapon that a user has a mastery maxed in: Parrying. If a player's mastery for the 
  weapon equipped is 100 or greater, there's a small chance that the person will parry a melee attack using that weapon.
  Using the style Weapon Master will help the odds of parrying an attack, but a person still needs 100 mastery first.
- Added a notification to the player style leveling up so players know when their style levels.

  weapon use: !augment add (weapon) (rune)  To remove an augment: !augment remove (weapon)   To see the current strength
  of augments that are in effect, use !augment strength   The strength only shows based on current armor/weapons.
- Added "Runes" to the items list. Runes are used to augment weapons with special effects. Use !runes to see which runes you own.
- Added boss drops to evil doppelgangers and warmachines. The drops will be random based on various items in items.db.
- Added silver chests and silver keys.
- Added purple chests and purple keys.
- Added Renkei (Skillchains). If two techniques that qualify (non-magic) are done to a target, it will activate a renkei that
  will deal additional damage to a target.
- Added a new stat: Ignition Gauge.  You can see your current ignition gauge by using !ig or !ignition gauge.  You can buy it
  in the shop with !buy stats IG #  Unlike hp/tp, buying them won't full the gauge to full. Ignition Gauge fills by +1 when you
  are in a winning battle or when you are killed by a monster.
- Added Ignitions! Ignitions are stronger boosts that you purchase in the shop via black orbs. They consume IgnitionGauge to
  use and to maintain during battle. Each Ignition has its own special effect and augment bonus that happens when you activate
  the ignition.
- Added the /me reverts from (Ignition Name) command.  Use this if you want to turn the Ignition off manually before 
  your IG runs out.
- Added the passive skill: TreasureHunter.  This skill will increase the odds of better colored chests when a chest is generated,
  and the odds of getting a random item at the end of battle if the monsters have one to give. This skill is cumulative with
  everyone who has it but in order to take effect, the players must be alive at the end of battle.
- Added the passive skill: BackGuard.  This skill will decrease the odds of monsters going first in battle. It's cumulative 
  with everyone who has it and is in battle.
- Added the active skill: Konzen-Ittai. This skill, when activated, will allow you to perform a self-Renkei with a non-magic, 
  non-AOE, technique.
- Added the active skill: Seal Break. This skill, when used, will consume Hankai and attempt to break the Melee-Only ancient
  seal that prevents players and monsters from using techniques that battle.
- Added the active skill: Magic Mirror. This skill, when used, will consume a MirrorShard and give the user the Reflect status.
- Added the active skill: Gamble. This skill, when used, will consume 1000 red orbs to summon a slot machine that will do
  something random.
- Added the active skill: ThirdEye. This skill, when used, will allow the user to dodge 1-2 attacks.
- Added the active skill: Scavenge. This skill, when used, will allow a player to try to dig something up out of the battlefield's
  ground. The items that are possible in the battlefields are set by the bot owner in battlefields.lst. Players can use this skill
  one time per battle, successfully or not. Each level in this skill increases the odds of finding an item.
- Added the active skill: Just Release. This skill, when used, will convert damage blocked via Royal Guard into an attack on
  a target. The amount of damage done is (skill level)% * blocked damage. After use, the blocked meter will be reset to 0.
  You can see how much you have stored in !stats.
- Added the monster-only skill: Magic Shift. When used, this skill will randomize what element a monster is strong/weak to and 
  healed by.
- Added the monster-only skill: DemonPortal. When used, this skill will allow a monster to create a Demon Portal monster.
  On the portal's turn, it will generate another monster onto the battlefield provided there's less than 5 monsters on the field.
  It will only stop when the portal is dead. Monsters with DemonPortal skill can also heal the portal.
- Added the monster-only skill: MonsterConsume. When used, a monster will eat/kill another monster and gain 40% of its stats
- Added the monster-only skill: MonsterSummon. When set right, a monster with this skill can summon a monster into the battle.
  Unlike BloodPact, it can be done multiple times. See Legion in the \bosses\ folder to see how to set it up right.
- Added a new command to clear descriptions you've set: !clear desc (name)  (remove the ()).  For example: 
  !clear desc character   or  !clear desc mightystrike 
- Added new achievements
- Added a new item type: IgnitionGauge.  This type will restore some of a player's IgnitionGauge. 
  The "IgnitionStar" is an example item but can only be found in chests.
- Added a new item: DunceCap. This item is crafted only. When used it will attempt to inflict IntDown on a target.
- Added a new item type: Snatch.  This item type will allow the user to attempt to grab a monster and use it as a shield (makes
  the monster cover the user).  The odds of it working depend on the level and speed of both user and target.
- Added a new item: Grappling_Hook, type snatch.
- Added the "bored" status. When inflicted upon a target, the target will miss a few turns.
- Added the "confused" status. When inflicted upon a target, the target will randomly attack opponents including his/her own
  allies.
- Added the "reflect" status. If someone casts a spell on someone who has this status, the spell will bounce back and hit the
  caster. Curing spells ignore the reflect status though if they heal.
- Added the "protect" status. When on, it cuts melee attacks down by half.
- Added the "shell" status. When on, it cuts magic damage down by half.
- Added the "resist-"element statuses. When on, it removes the ability for the magic effects (such as burning, shocked, frozen)
  from working.  If the resistances are applied via a buff technique, such as BarFire, it will also give a +30% resistance to
  the element.
- Added a new special boss fight: Demon Wall.  In this type the bot will generate a demon wall based on the current 
  battle streak. This boss fight is also timed; darkness will occur in 5 minutes and it's instant death if darkness triggers.
- Added a new special boss fight: Elder Dragons.  In this type, the bot will randomly generate a powerful Elder Dragon for
  the heroes to fight. The name of the dragon is completely random, as is its elemental weaknesses/resists.
- Added two new battle formulas. Bot Admins can use !toggle Battle Formula to switch between them.  The version 1.0-1.5 formula
  is now gone. Bot Owners can switch it manually in system.dat [system] BattleDamageFormula=1 or 2  By default, 2 is default.
- Added a IgnoreDmgCap flag in system.dat.  If set to true then damage will no longer be capped under any formulas. 
- Added the ability for monsters to be immune to Weapon Lock. Under [Skills] add Resist-Weaponlock=100   Unlike other resists,
  this one is either all or none.  If it's not 100, then weapon lock will always work.
- Added the ability for monsters and NPCs (not shadow clones) to use ignitions. In order for a monster/npc to use an ignition
  they must have 100+ IgnitionGauge under the [battle] section AND must have a valid ignition in [ignitions] (ignitionName=1)
  Like other techs, it's a random chance that they will use it.
- Added the ability for players to take the monsters by surprise and go first in battle at random.
- Added battlefield events! At random, various things may happen at the end of a turn now including healing, damaging or
  inflicting a status on either everyone, all players, all monsters, or just a random person. Bot owners can disable this
  in system.dat under [system] EnableBattlefieldEvents=  and bot admins can use !toggle battlefield events
- Added armor! Basic armor can be found in chests, middle grade armor can be crafted and higher level armor can be found via
  bosses. To wear armor use: !wear armor name  to remove: !remove armor name. 
- Added Portal Items. These items, when used, will wipe out the current battle and teleport all players to a special battlefield
  to face a difficult boss. Winning or losing these battles doesn't affect the current battle streak.
- Added portal items to the shop. use !shop list portal and !shop buy portal (item) (amount).  Portal items are not bought with
  red orbs, but rather via BeastmenSeals and KindredSeals.
- Added the ability for regular monsters to drop items to the most stylish person. It's a 30% chance, if a monster in the
  battle has a drops=item in their [info] section.
- Added a random chance that a double turn will occur without Sugitekai.
- Added Allied Notes. You can see your own allied notes with: !allied notes  and other people with !allied notes Person 
  Allied Notes can be used to purchase things in the shop (use !shop list alliednotes)
- Added the ability for battles to end in a draw if all the monsters and players are dead at the same time.
- Added the ability for bot admins to enable a Double Currency Event.  While this event is on, red orbs will be doubled.  
  Bot admins can enable and disable it using !toggle bonus event 
- Added the ability for monsters and npcs to use bloodpact. However, their summon has to be set manually and it's a good idea
  to set a description (else it will be displayed wrong).  To set the summon in [Skills] put Summon=name  The name must be a
  summon that exists in the \summons\ folder.  To set the description: [descriptions] bloodpact=desc here
  Look at the Yagudo_Summoner monster for an example.
- Added a new style: CounterStance.  This style will enhance the odds of countering melee attacks done against you. Higher levels
  obviously increases the odds. This style also gives access to the !perfect counter skill that can be used one time per battle
  to ensure one 100% melee counter.
- Added the ability for melee attacks to be countered. When this happens, the person who attacks will end up taking damage.
- Added an !achievements command so you can see which achievements you have unlocked. Can also use it to check other people:
  !achievements person
- Added a !clear achievement command for bot admins. It's !clear achievement person nameofachievement  
- Added a new command: !total deaths person   This command will show how many times a monster/boss/player has been defeated
  in battle.  Unfortunately, it only starts counting bosses and monsters after this update has been applied, so it won't show 
  you how many times those have been beaten prior to this update. Players it will, though, as that's been in the bot for a while.
- Added a new command: !deathboard <monster/boss>  It basically generates a scoreboard based on the monster's or boss' total
  deaths.
- Added the ability for techs and weapons to inflict a status type upon its user. Right now it's a 100% chance. To add it, 
  add SelfStatus=statustype in the tech/weapon.
- Added the ability for monsters to attempt to grab players and use them as shields if they have snatch=1 set in their [skills]
- Added the ability for monsters to have "natural armor" -- Think of it as a shield that has to be broken before the monsters 
  can take damage. Look at the boss Cerberus to see how it's done.
- Added the ability for weapons and techniques to ignore some or all of a target's defense. In techniques.db and weapons.db
  under the name of the tech/weapon, put IgnoreDefense= and the value can be 0 to 100  0 means none, 100 means 100% 
  of def is ignored. 
- Added an IgnoreDrain=true/false flag for monsters, bosses and npcs. When set to true, stuff like Drain Samba and techs
  that normally give back some of the damage in HP won't activate on the target.
- Added the ability for techniques to have multiple hits (like weapons). Use hits= in the [tech] name in techniques.db.
  Unlike weapons, techniques can go up to 8 total hits.
- Added the Biome option to monsters.  In [info] you can put Biome=  and the list has to be valid battlefield types or
  left blank.  If set, the monster will only have a chance to show up if the battlefield matches one of the biomes in the
  list.  You can set multiples like so: Biome=river.beach.desert
- Added the spells Protect and Shell to almost every wand/staff. These spells will bestow the buff Protect or Shell upon
  the target. 
- Added the ability for monsters to drop green, white and orange orbs upon dying. These small temporary orbs will restore
  some hp, tp or ignition gauge to the person who kills the monster. Note that using AOEs to kill the monsters will result
  in no orbs being dropped. They only drop on melee and single-target techs.
- Added healing caps on healing spells. Bot admins can set them in techniques.db, [healing spell name] MaxAmount=
  If left blank the max amount is 2000+(total amount done /100) 
- Added the ability for monsters, npcs and bosses to "learn" immunities to technique names.  In their files under 
  [monster] put TechLearn=true to make it active.  What it does is make it so if someone uses a tech on the target 
  with this set to true, the next time the same tech is used on the target it will be counted as immunity/null damage 
  (essentially only allowing the tech to work once against the target).
- Added a simplistic Conquest system. As players and monsters battle, the bot will keep track of points. At the end of 5 days
  the bot will tally up and see who has majority control over the world. When players have majority control they will receive
  an orb bonus based on the amount of points they had earned during that conquest period (up to 1000 orbs per battle). Players
  can use !conquest info to see how the conquest is going and how many hours are left before it tallies.
- Changed the zombie regen to scale a bit better so that lower streaks won't have 100+ hp regenerated.
- Changed the way red orbs are rewarded so that lower streaks have a much lower max orbs and higher streaks can actually give
  more than 100%. 
- Changed the key and chest drop rates.
- Changed the shop so that there's a cap on the old-style boosts. Players can now only own 500 levels into them.
- Changed the "First round protection" code so that it should also protect players from being one-shotted on monsters from a
  new wave.
- Changed the way the bot does the status effects to try and make it show them in the channel better and to block players from
  being able to control their actions until all of the status effects have been displayed (to prevent various bugs).
- Changed the damage amount that magic special effects (burning, drowning, shocked, etc) do to targets. It's now increased to
  5% of maximum HP of the target.
- Changed the Melee-Only type battles so that they no longer appear during boss battles.
- Changed the way status effects work so that multiple status effects may be used at a time on techs/weapons/items. Just
  be sure to add them like this: status.status.status  (note the . inbetween the status effects)
- Changed AOEs so that if the person who initiated the AOE dies at any point during the AOE, the AOE itself will stop cold.
- Changed the bot so that seasonal monsters don't need to be copied manually over. In order for the bot to load them during the
  correct month, set this: streak=-1000  and month=01 or month=02 or month=03, etc under [info].  See Robot_Santa or
  Gobbles for an example.
- Changed Quicksilver so that it can't be used multiple times in a row. There has to be at least 1 turn between uses.
- Changed the way the bot gets the items inside the chests. Now bot owners have more control over it. See chests.lst for the
  lists and the ability to edit them.
- Changed !items so that the keys are no longer listed there. Use !keys to see the keys you have.
- Changed the Final Getsuga type boost so that while it's on EVERY AUGMENT will be on at the same time.
- Changed the !items code so that it clears out items that the player has 0 of in their files.
- Changed the curse night and melee-only events so that they won't occur below streak 50.
- Changed the orb reward code so that people who flee from battle will not receive the OrbHunter or Accessory orb bonuses.
- Changed the clear_battle alias code a little to try and make it slightly faster and better at clearing out monsters/npcs and
  bad files
- Changed the !scoreboard command to show a varying amount of top players depending on how many players are in the game. It will
  now show the top 3, the top 5, or the top 10.
- Changed !status and the turn status line to show some of the skills active on the person.
- Changed many of the basic character commands (such as !hp, !tp, !items, !skills, etc) to work in private message as well
  as the channel. Now if you use those commands in a private message, the message will be displayed privately to you. If you
  use them in the channel, it will be as it was before and show the message in the channel.
- Changed the Steal skill so that it now loads the steal pools from steal.lst. It is now possible for individual monsters/bosses
  to drop different things, rather than every monster or boss sharing from a global pool.
- Changed how the resistances/weaknesses/immunities/heals to elements, weapons and techs work in the files.  Now there's a 
  [modifiers] section.  Setting the element/weapon/tech to 0 means the monster is completely immune to it.  Setting it to 
  100 means they will take normal damage from it.  Anything above 100 is a weakness, anything below 100 is a resistance. Remember 
  that it's in percent, so 125 = 125% damage from it.
- Changed items so that they will now hurt targets that are under the ethereal status.
- Changed the code slightly for the shop so that other VIP membership card-like accessories could be created and used 
  (instead of mine only).
- Fixed a bug in which selling a technique might result in 0 orbs back.
- Fixed a bug in which cover would activate when a monster used taunt on a covered target.
- Fixed an issue where setting a high difficulty would still result in low level monsters on lower streaks. Now it summons the
  correct level monsters.
- Fixed an issue with magic effect deaths in which they wouldn't check for the revive status or for the spawn after death function
- Fixed a bug with chests that gave orbs. It would write a red=orbs orbs orbs line or black=orbs orbs orbs line in the 
  player's item_amount section.  That should be fixed now.
- Fixed a bug with the GIVE command in which a misspelled name would cause an error that would stop the bot in its tracks.
- Fixed a bug with the GIVE command in which giving more than one item would cause the receiver to only receive 1 of the item
  and the rest would be lost.
- Fixed a bug with the GIVE Command in which it wouldn't display an error message correctly if fractions of an item was used.
- Fixed a bug in which players could exploit the bot using descriptions.
- Fixed a bug in which the healing items weren't checking for max hp correctly, thus allowing you to heal someone who didn't
  need it.
- Fixed a bug with the mugger's belt accessory in which it wasn't calculating damage correctly.
- Fixed the !view-info display for weapons if the weapon has multiple hits.
- Fixed an issue where using a tonic would remove a weapon tech boost if someone had it on.

2.1
- Added the REFORGE command. Using !reforge weapon  a player can get a random augment on the weapon. The cost is
  2x the weapon's black orb cost and 1 RepairHammer. The augment is completely random and will overwrite any current augments.
- Added the active skill: BloodSpirit. This skill works like BloodBoost only instead of STR it gives INT.
- Added the passive skill: DivineBlessing. This skill reduces the chance of a curse night from happening. It's a cumulative
  effect (muchlike BackGuard).
- Added the ability to see the total number of deaths of monsters and bosses. Use !deathboard monster/boss total
- Added the ability to see how many conquest points the leading party (monsters or heroes) has by using !conquest points
- Added the ability to control your shadow clones. First, you must be using the Doppelganger style or else they'll still
  control themselves. Next, when it's the clone's turn, use !shadow (command [tech/skill name]) (target) to do it. commands are:
  taunt, attack, tech, skill.  For example: !shadow tech inferno bee
- Added a !view-info style (style)  command to display information on the various styles.
- Added new valid battlefield limitations to the bot.
- Added the ability to set a custom max orb limit for gauntlet battles. In system.dat under [system] put MaxGauntletOrbReward=
  By default the maxGauntletOrbReward is set to 50,000 (this is before the bonus from the level of gauntlet is calculated).
- Added a new skill type: Killer Traits. These skills will increase melee damage against a specific monster type by 1% each level
- Added a new method in the bot that checks to see how many battles were empty/not played. If it's greater than a set number, 
  the bot will automatically reset the streak to 0. The amount of battles before this happens can be set in system.dat.
- Added dragonballs to the game. Dragonballs can be randomly found only by winning boss battles. When all 7 are collected
  the dragon Shenron will grant a powerful bonus to the next ten active battles.
- Added the command !dragonballs that will tell you the status of the dragonball hunt or if Shenron's Wish is active.
- Added the command: !misc info (person)  that will show misc statistical info on yourself or other characters.
- Added black keys and black chests
- Added the ability for any techs performed using a weapon that can hurt ethereal monsters to also hurt ethreal monsters. Prior
  to this, only magic techs would hurt them or players would need the augment.
- Added the ability for bot owners to adjust the time of chests before they're destroyed. In system.dat under [system] there's
  now ChestTime=   the time is in seconds and the default is 45.
- Added Ignition Techs. These are special techs that can only be used while an ignition is on. They are not tied to any weapon
  but still consume TP like a normal tech.
- Added two special Anniversary monsters that will only show up in July to help celebrate the anniversary of the bot's creation.
- Added a way for monsters/bosses to be immune to Quicksilver. In [info] put IgnoreQuicksilver=true 
- Added a new negative status effect: removeboost. If used on someone who is ignition boosted, it will knock the target out
  of that boost. It does not work on FinalGetsuga or weapon boosts. 
- Changed the active skill Third Eye so that it only works on physical attacks. It also now has its own dodge message.
- Changed the chance of certain monsters building a demon portal from 35% down to 25%.
- Changed the AbsorbIG Augment so that it's weaker on players and stronger on monsters.
- Changed Just Release so that shadow copies cannot use it.
- Changed alchemy/crafting so that crafted items can require more than one of the same ingredient.  Glass, for example, now
  takes 5 sand to craft.
- Changed a little bit of code in the control.mrc to help improve things. Thanks to Andrio
- Changed Shadow Clones so that they only change weapons when their owners do.
- Changed the Hurt Ethereal rune so that techniques done with the weapon that has this rune on will now hurt ethereal monsters.
- Changed food and shop lowering items to work in battle without consuming a turn. As a note, if you use food while a battle is
  ongoing you won't see the stat increases til AFTER the battle has ended.  This is for everyone, not just people in the battle.
- Changed the way the 'ancient melee-only seal' thing works so that it's based on battlefields now, rather than a random chance.
- Changed the way Conquest Points are calculated. There is no longer a penalty for having more than one player in battle. However
  the overall amount of points has been slightly nerfed.
- Changed the way the scoreboard is generated so that the scores are a little more reasonable. Bot Admins can toggle between the
  old and new methods by using !toggle scoreboard type
- Changed the !save battle streak command so that it can be used once an hour, down from once every 2 hours.
- Changed the !reload battle streak command so that it will work on a winning streak as long as it's 10 or under.
- Changed the amount of conquest points players lose if the battle was lost on the first turn.
- Changed portal items so that they won't work during gauntlets and boss battles.
- Changed a lot of code to make it much more efficient.  The bot should be faster now when clearing out files.
- Changed the way the bot builds many of the lists to display to the channel.  I've restructured a lot of things (notice 
  many new .lst files). Weather.lst is now defunct, its function has been moved into battlefields.db.  The list of chest items
  are now in the chest_(color).lst file rather than a single chests.lst file.
- Changed golden chests to remove black orbs from them. This is because bot-generated bosses can use golden chests as their 
  drop pools and if it were to pick a black orb it wouldn't be added right.
- Changed Demon Walls so that they're based on turns rather than a timer. The default is that after 
  the 10th turn the players will lose (i.e. beginning of turn 11).
- Changed the healing type techniques so that they will not heal demon_portals (it will just heal 0 damage).
- Changed the AI code slightly to try and avoid the "Error: is not currently in this battle!" message.
- Changed the formula for the regen skill so that it's now: ((max hp * skill level %) / 2) 
- Fixed an issue with the wrong password counter not being reset sometimes after logging in.
- Fixed an issue in which cure-status type items (such as tonic) would not cure confuse and would actually make it worse.
- Fixed a bug that Raiden found in which new characters wouldn't be able to equip armor.
- Fixed a bug in which monster snatch descriptions weren't being displayed.
- Fixed a bug in which the demon portal's idle description wasn't being displayed.
- Fixed a bug with the error messages in !view-info
- Fixed a bug in which the total deaths of monsters/bosses were being increased by 2 if killed by an AOE.
- Fixed a bug in which battles with monster summons could potentially freeze and never end.
- Fixed a bug in which bot admins would sometimes be unable to force a character to create a shadow clone using the 'does' command.
- Fixed a bug in which the "has no skills" message wouldn't display when a character had no skills.
- Fixed a bug in which DCC battles would potentially freeze if a key is rewarded.
- Fixed a bug with the shop in which it was possible to increase your shop level without actually getting anything in return.
- Fixed a bug in which the !view-info command wasn't showing status types on techs.
- Fixed a potential issue with evil doppelgangers and the auto-revive augment in which they could also gain that status effect.
- Fixed a bug with !status in which certain skills weren't being displayed correctly when they were active.
- Fixed a few typos.
- Fixed a bug with the error message with !enter
- Fixed a bug with the OK message for setting descriptions when setting a description in DCC mode.
- Fixed a bug in which sometimes using a single hit tech after a multi-hit tech would cause some errors.
- Fixed a bug in which anyone could use any ignition as long as he/she had the IG for it even if he/she didn't purchase it.
- Fixed a bug in which capped healing amounts were not working right.
- Fixed a bug in which an error message didn't display if someone attempted to snatch a boss.

2.2
- Added mimics! The default chance is 5% and only takes effect at streak 50 or above. When a mimic happens it will start a battle
  with the mimic as a special type of monster. Bot admins can change the % by using !mimic chance # where # is 1-100
- Added a new special boss fight: Bandits.  In this type, the bot will randomly generate a random group of bandits for the
  heroes to fight. 
- Added the ability for item names to be used as modifiers on monsters. Like weapons/elements, 0 is null, 100 is normal, under
  100 is strength, over 100 is weakness.
- Added En- buffs to the pixi wand. These buffs will enchant melee attacks with the ability to do the extra magical damage (burning,
  drowning, etc). Like the magic version, the player must be more than 20 levels. Only one En- element can be on at a time.
  En-spells also give a boost to melee damage if the target is weak to the en-spell element.
- Added the ability for the bot to retally the number of total battles, making it more accurate.
- Added a new accessory type (IncreaseTreasureOdds) that increases the odds of getting better colored chests.
- Added two new stat increase types: BlackOrbs and RedOrbs. They increase the orb amounts when used.
- Added a new tech type: ClearStatusNegative  When used on a target it will remove most negative status effects. It will not
  remove charm from a target or any of the magic effects (burning, frozen, etc). Added Esuna as an example.
- Added a new tech type: ClearStatusPositive  When used on a target it will remove most positive status effects. It will not
  remove boosts or auto-revive. Added Dispel as an example.
- Added the ability for monsters to change the current battlefield. To make it happen, in [skills] add:
  ChangeBattlefield=1  and ChangeBattlefield.battlefields=battlefield1.battlefield2.etc   and ChangeBattlefield.chance=
  where the # you supply will be the percent of it happening. If no chance is provided, 15% is used as default.
- Added mechs! You can purchase a mech for 1000 Allied Notes using !shop mech buy   For a list of all commands please
  read the MECH section in the player's guide.
- Added the ability to turn off taunting for monsters and npcs. Under [info] put CanTaunt=true/false   If it's not there it's 
  assumed to be true.
- Added the ability to have custom taunts for various monsters/npcs/bosses. Under [info] put TauntFile=  where the file that
  the taunts are located in.  For example: [info] TauntFile=taunts_Vergil.txt  
- Added a monster only skill: RepairNaturalArmor.  This skill will allow a monster to restore all of its natural armor after
  it has been depleted to 0.  Keep in mind it will restore all of it to max when the skill is used.
- Added a new bot admin command: !main folder cleanup   Use this to clean the main bot folder. It'll remove .lst, .txt and .db files
- Added a new battle type: Save the President.  In this battle, heroes must defeat monsters while protecting the Allied Forces
  President. If the president dies the battle will be over and the heroes will lose. This type of battle does not affect the streak.
- Added a check to the bot for old characters. Characters that have not been logged into after 6 months will be removed.
  The files will be moved to the zapped folder in case bot owners need to restore them.
- Added a flag for items to make them only available if players won the previous conquest period. In items.db add 
  ConquestItem=true to any item you want to only show up that way. Assumed to be false if missing.
- Added the !conquest record command. It will show you the total number of conquest tallies and who has won them.
- Added the ability for techniques to have Pre and Post scripts that can run. This should not be done unless you know what
  you're doing. Add them as Prescript= and Postscript=   You can have one and not the other, both, or none at all.
  Some notes: $1 = the attacker, $2 = the tech name, $3 = the target; Use $display.system.message(MESSAGE HERE,battle) 
  to display a message to make it work right in both DCC mode and IRC mode. (don't use any commas in the message itself 
  though or it'll cause the message to be cut off)
- Added an automated 1 vs 1 AI battle type.  Bot admins can start it by using !startbat ai or the bot can be set to do this 
  type of battle automatically by toggling it via !toggle automated ai battle but note that players cannot join this type of 
  battle so it should only be set to automatically do this if no one wants to play but you still want battles to happen 
  (it won't affect the streak). 
- Added the ability to exchange allied notes for $$double dollars and vice versa. Use !exchange alliednotes/doubledollars #
  to convert to the opposite currency.  It's 1 note for $$2 or $$2 for 1 note
- Added the ability to bet on the outcome of 1vs1 battles. Use !bet npc # or !bet monster # to place a bet.
- Added the ability for bot owners to change the number of phantom betters that place bets on the 1vs1 battles. In system.dat
  under [system] put PhantomBetters=#  the # has to be greater than 3.  Note that a huge number will bog down your machine.
- Added the active skill Formless Strike.  Using this skill will consume 50% of your TP but will allow you to hurt ethereal
  monsters without the augment or special weapon.
- Added the PinkBow accessory.  This accessory will add +50% resistance against all status effects (except curse on curse 
  night of course).  It's basically like a lite version of the Ribbon.
- Added an accessorytypes.lst to the \lst\ folder.  It isn't used for anything in the bot, but it does give a list of 
  valid accessory types for bot owners who want to create their own accessories.  Of course you can always look in 
  items.db for examples on how to do most of the types.
- Added "All" as a valid status target for ignitions.

- Changed the cooldown timers on Blood Boost and Blood Spirit
- Changed view-info on ignitions to show the ignition techs.
- Changed how the AI system works. I've recoded a lot of it. It should be better about picking skills, techs, ignitions/etc that
  it can actually use (i.e. has enough tp or ig for, etc).
- Changed the AI so that it can only use BloodBoost and BloodSpirit once.
- Changed how the bot determines which boss battle type to choose. It's much cleaner now.
- Changed how the bot reads .lst, .txt, and .db files. They're in their own folders now.

  Valid types are: normal, bandits, doppelganger, warmachine, demonwall, elderdragon
- Changed a few things in translation.dat to make it read better.
- Changed parry and dodge so that a target cannot perform those actions while stunned or paralyzed.
- Changed !achievements to show how many achievements have been acquired vs how many there are total.
- Changed the chance of multiple waves happening (lowered it at higher streaks)
- Changed curse nights and surprise attacks so that they cannot happen twice in a row.
- Changed the ElementalDefense type accessories so that the amount they block can be changed in items.db under Amount=
  The amount is a percent, so .50 = 50% damage blocked.
- Changed the Steal Power tech so that it's possible to dodge or block it (utsusemi works now)
- Changed the Steal Power tech to add a cap amount based on the current streak level.  The higher the streak, the higher 
  the amount is that the user can absorb from a target.
- Changed the BlockAllStatus type accessories (ribbon and pinkbow) so that bot owners can give the accessory an 
  amount to block.  The amount is a direct amount (so Amount=100 means it's +100%)
- Changed the code for how the bot checks for accessories to make it much better.  It's more like augments now.
- Changed the way the bot looks for skills to read from .lst files
- Changed the cost on certain items and seals.

  !access add player - Adds a player to the access list.

  !access list  - Lists who can control the character.
  To actually control the character, use the same commands as the bot admin commands, such as: name attacks target
  or name does skillname   ** This does not change anything with bot admins. They can still control everything 
  like they did prior.  This also does not work in DCC mode due to the way DCC mode works.
- Added a Mimic Ring accessory. It's craftable using a Treasure Ring and a Mimic Core.
- Added a new item type ("Special Items")

  Medium weapons are +40% damage on medium monsters, neutral against small monsters and -30% damage on large monsters.
  Large weapons are +40% damage on large monsters, neutral on medium monsters and -40% damage on small monsters.
- Added a flag for monsters and bosses where they won't show up during 'save the president' type battles. In [info] put
  IgnorePresident=true   
- Added the ability for the bot to generate an HTML file with the stats of every player.  This is done when the !scoreboard
  command is used. This feature can be turned on/off via the bot admin command !toggle scoreboard html
  The HTML file is generated in the main bot folder.
- Added a new boss battle type: Crystal Shadow Warrior.  This battle will require thinking outside the box to win.
- Added the "counteronly" AI type for monsters. These monsters will counter all melee attacks and take no damage from tech
  and items.  It is recommended this type only be set with the HurtByTaunt flag, else they cannot be defeated.
- Added the HurtByTaunt=true/false flag for [info]. If set to true, taunts will deal damage when used against the monster.
- Added the HealByTaunt=true/false flag for [info]. If set to true, taunts will heal damage when used against the monster.

  ignore utsusemi shadows.
- Added the ability for defender AI type monsters to show a description each round. In [descriptions] DefenderAI=desc here
  Note, that it won't show the monster's name in this description.  You can use %real.name for the monster's name. 
  If you want the monster's name to be bold use $chr(2) $+ %real.name $+ $chr(2) description here
- Added the ability for monsters to have custom death messages. In [descriptions] put DeathMessage=message here.
  You don't need to add the monster's name at the start of the message as the bot will add that automatically.

- Changed !reforge to not work inside battles

  If the streak is 1000+ levels higher than the current level, the orbs are nerfed down to 1.5% of the orb total.
  If the streak is 500-1000 levels it's nerfed down to 2% of the orb total.
  If the streak is 100-500 levels higher it's 4.5% of the orb total.  Players leveled above or within 100 have no penalty.
- Changed the battle list to show monsters/players who have fled in red to help identify them.
- Changed some code to hopefully make it so the bot can be run in folders that have spaces in them. I'd still recommend the
  bot be run in a non-space folder (such as C:\BattleArena\) but it shouldn't come to a grinding halt any more if you don't.
- Changed the !new char command a bit to make it slightly more efficient and hopefully stop it from randomly stopping 
  if it encounters a bad file.

  It goes in [info]
- Added a new special boss fight: Wall of Flesh.  In this type the bot will generate a wall of flesh based on the current 
  battle streak. This boss fight is similar to the Demon Wall and the battle will end in a loss if 16 turns pass.
- Added a new AI type: TauntOnly.  As it suggests, anything with this ai type will do nothing but taunt.
- Added a new active skill: Lockpicking.  This skill allows anyone who has it, and has the lockpick item, to attempt to
  unlock a chest without needing the correct key.  
- Added a new passive skill: DualWield. This skill will allow a player to equip two weapons and use techniques from either
  of the weapons without needing to switch. For melee attacks, the # of hits for the attack will be both weapon's # of hits
  combined. Use !equip left weaponname and !equip right weaponname
- Added "Players Must Die" mode. Inspired by Dante Must Die mode in DMC, this mode makes monsters harder and makes it so
  players will not restore full hp/tp at the end of battle.

  equip armor or accessories

  to unequip armor or accessories
- Added instruments and songsheets to the Bard merchant.
- Added "singing"-- use /me sings <name of song here>  to use a song in battle.  Each song has a different effect in battle.
  Each song also requires a certain instrument to perform.
- Added !view-info song <songname>  that will give information on a particular song.
- Added the ability for monsters to sing songs. In [skills] put singing=1  and then [songs] list the songs you want them to have
- Added the ability for monsters to be "inactive" until they're hit. While inactive they do not need to be defeated in order
  for the battle to end. To make this happen, [battle] status=inactive
- Added a new player style: Beasmaster.  While using this style, players will be able to control their summons manually. 
  The commands are the same as if they were trying to control a linked player (such as summonname attacks target)
- Added shields! To use them, players need the DualWield skill. The shop command is !shop list shields and !shop buy shield name
  Note that shields are sold by an NPC merchant and if the merchant is not there or kidnapped then shields will be unavailable.
- Added two new flags for weapons: CanCounter and CanShieldReflect.  canCounter can be set to false if you don't want a melee
  attack from that weapon to ever be countered. If CanShieldReflect is set to true then the attack will always be countered 
  if the target is using a shield. Think Deku Scrubs from Zelda.
- Added the Shield Merchant NPC. 
- Added the Traveling Merchant NPC. He'll show up every month for 5 days of the month: from the 15th to the 20th. He sells
  two accessories a month (one accessory is static, the other changes every month).
- Added the Wheel Master NPC. Unlike the other NPCs, he starts off kidnapped and does not have any requirements to be 
  rescued/come to the Allied Forces HQ.   Once he's saved, you can use the !wheel help and !wheel spin commands.
- Added the Wheel Minigame.  It needs the Wheel Master in the Allied Forces HQ to be played.  Default cost is 500 red orbs and
  can be played once per 24 hours.
- Added the Gardener NPC. Once he's been rescued from monsters players will have access to the garden.
- Added the Allied Forces HQ Garden. Use !garden help, !garden plant itemname, and !garden status to interact with it.
  The Gardener NPC must be rescued in order to use the garden.
- Added new portal items/battles.
- Added the "Time of Day" to the bot.  The bot will cycle through morning->noon->evening->night at 2 battles per time.
- Added the monster flag TimeOfDay=  where you can choose what times of day you want the monsters to show up. It goes
  in [info]
- Added the command !time to show you the current time of day and the # of what day it is.
- Added code for the bot to keep track of the number of days that the heroes have been fighting. 
  Remember that the "day" it is is based on the cycle of morning to morning (every 8 battles by default).
- Added a new system.dat flag: AllowColors=true/false.  If set to false, the bot will strip the colors from the messages
  it sends out.  It's set to true by default.
- Added the ability for monsters and bosses to have DeathConditions. The mon/boss will only die if the right type of
  attack is used to kill them, otherwise they will be revived.  In [info] put DeathConditions=  valid list is:
  melee, magic, tech, item, renkei, status, magiceffect  You can list multiple by putting a period inbetween 
  such as: melee.magic.status    Leave this blank if you want the mon/boss to die from any type of attack.
- Added the ability for npcs/monsters/bosses to have custom revive descriptions. [descriptions] revive=
  Don't add the name of the person in this line as the bot will add it automatically.  
- Added a new botType option in system.dat: TWITCH.  Using botType=TWITCH will cause all private messages to be sent
  to the channel as Twitch does not support notify or msg.  As such, there's a chance that the bot might be kicked for
  flooding. Use at your own risk.  Note that the !id command is NOT needed for characters in this mode.
- Added a new flag in system.dat for TWITCH mode: TwitchDelayTime. Using this it's possible to adjust how slowly the bot
  spits out messages while in TWITCH mode. The default is 2 seconds.
- Added !add person DoubleDollars #  - Bot admins can use this to give doubledollars to a player.
- Added !take person DoubleDollars #  - Bot admins can use this to remove doubledollars from a player.
- Added a player level command: !level sync #   Using this command, players can adjust their levels to any level under
  what they are currently.  The level sync will wear off at the end of the next battle.
- Changed the way passwords behave. Now they are hashes rather than encodes.  In order for this to work, the bot must
  be running version 6.3 or higher (the old version, 6.16 will still use encode for anyone who doesn't want to upgrade).
- Changed the Auto Next so that it will boot anyone who misses 3 turns in a single battle out of the battle (sets them

- Changed Kikouheni so that it now adds the "weatherlock" condition to the battlefield. This means the battlefield won't
  change weather on its own any more.

  or empty in drops.db, it will attempt to read the drop list in the actual monster/boss .char file.

  [Info] Guardian=   Can add multiple with periods inbetween:  Monster1.Monster2.Monster3
