[Info]
Trickster=This style will enhance the amount of style points you get for taunting. Higher levels of Trickster will increase the amount of style points you get. It'll also give you a bonus to your speed in battle.  Higher levels of the style will result in a bigger increase in speed. When equipped with this style there's also a (style level)% chance of dodging attacks. 

WeaponMaster=This style will enhance melee attacks of all weapon types.  It does this by increasing the random damage added onto every melee attack and by enhancing the mastery skill slightly.  The amount increases each time the style levels.

Guardian=This style will decrease the amount of damage you take by a percent each level (up to 60% max). This style will allow you to use the !sentinel command as many times as your style is currently leveled.

SpellMaster=This will enhance magic by roughly 11% per level (up to 90% max).

Doppelganger=This style will enhance your shadow clone ability, giving your clone more health.  The amount of health the clone gets goes up with each level of the style, up to 100%. Also, with this style equipped it is possible to control your shadow clones by using the !shadow command on the clone's turn. Shadow commands are: 
Doppelganger2=!shadow attack (target), !shadow taunt (target), !shadow tech (tech name) (target), !shadow skill (skillname) (target [if necessary])

Quicksilver=This style will allow you to access the !quicksilver command that freezes everyone except you in battle, effectively giving you an extra turn. You can use the !quicksilver command as many times as your style is currently leveled.

HitenMitsurugi-ryu=This style will enhance melee and tech damage done with katana weapons and enhance speed at battle turn generation.

SharpShooter=This style will enhance melee and tech damage done with guns and bows as well as give access to the !overcharge ability.  Overcharge will further boost damage done with guns and bows and can be used as many times in battle as the style is leveled.

CounterStance=This style will enhance the chance of doing a counter attack by 2% each level. It also allows you to use !perfectcounter once per battle in which you will be able to counter a single melee attack.

Beastmaster=This style will allow you to control your summon manually while the style is equipped.

Wrestlemania=Aim for the top of the wrestling federation and perform your stunning wrestling moves upon your enemies! This style will allow you to use !wrestle targetname command as many times as your style is currently leveled as well as enhance your hand to hand attacks. Note that wrestling cannot KILL a target, only hurt and stun.

HighRoller=Gamble your way to victory with this highly luck-based style. This style will allow you to unlock the full potential of the Trading Cards with !CardShark cardname target and use the !Gamble skill without equipping it (and at a lower cost!). As the style levels you will be able to use higher rarity cards.

TreasureHunter=Sneak and Steal--er I mean Treasure Hunt--your way to riches. This style will enhance your dagger usage, increase your chance of receiving spoils, enhance your stealing chance and give you access to !TrickAttack, !SneakAttack, and !Bribe. Sneak Attack will make your next attack critical if you have the lowest enmity. Trick Attack will make your next attack be critical if you have the highest enmity and reduce your enmity to 1 after the attack. Trick & Sneak Attack cannot be used solo. Using Bribe you can attempt to make a monster flee battle by paying red orbs.
