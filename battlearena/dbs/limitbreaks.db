==============================================
Limit breaks are powerful single target attacks
that deal a multiplier to a player's normal
melee damage hit.  For example, CrossSlash does
1.5xmelee hit damage.  So if a player normally
did 100 damage it would now do 150.  

Limit breaks will fully consume the limit break 
bar even if it only requires 100% to perform. 

Limit breaks are created as follows:

[Name]
Name=The name (can be with spaces)
Cost=The cost, in black orbs. 0 means can't purchase
Multiplier=The damage multiplier
MeterNeeded=100-400 what % does the player need
            to perform this limit break?
Desc=What is shown when the limit break is used.


Don't forget to add the limit break to 
limitbreaks.lst if you want players to be able
to purchase them.
