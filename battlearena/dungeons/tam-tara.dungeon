Desc=The party approaches the platform. Ahead they can see the glowing blue orb is shooting a bright light towards a large circular room ahead. The room is protected by another blue barrier. Inside of the protected room they see the five men in dark robes all chanting an ancient language.

Desc=The final barrier disappears. The party rushes forward into the large circular room but they are too late. Waves of energy shoot from each of the cultists and their bodies fade away as their life force gives life to Galvanth the Dominator--a large Soulflayer. It lets off a large roar and looks at the heroes with destruction in its eyes.
