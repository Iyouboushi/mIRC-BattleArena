[DescriptionsLamia]

2=As the party quickly heads towards the throne room they can hear the screeching of more Quadav running to meet them and prevent their way forward!

2=The cavern grows darker and more menancing as the heroes are getting closer to the center.  As they continue forward they see a wave of Orc soldiers running towards them.
